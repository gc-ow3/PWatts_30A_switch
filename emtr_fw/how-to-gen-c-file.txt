To generate a C data file of the EMTR binary
(NOTE: ensure this is a binary with our header prepended)

1. cd to the folder holding the EMTR binary

2. run xxd command:
xxd -i -a -c 16 emtr-hdr-x.y.z.bin emtr_fw.c

3. Edit emtr_fw.c
   a. Insert a comment line at the top of the file showing the version e.g.
      // EMTR 0.7.1
   b. Change the first line to:
      const unsigned char emtrFwBin[] = {
   c. Change the last line to:
      const unsigned int emtrFwBinLen = sizeof(emtrFwBin);

Copy the file to <path>/app_driver, overwriting the existing file
